\section{INTRODUCTION}
A File Transfer Protocol~(FTP) was designed, implemented and tested by the authors using socket programming in python 3. The purpose of this project is to create a custom FTP protocol in order to fundamentally understand how protocols operate. This document assumes that the reader is familiar with computer networking and the terminology used. This document includes sections on the Design and Implementation, Code Functionality, Testing and Results, SWAT Analysis, Division of Tasks and Future Improvements. 

\section{BACKGROUND}
FTP is an RFC959 \cite{rfc959} standardised file sharing~(or file transferring) protocol that uses separate control and data connections between a client and server\cite{tcp}. Protocols define the rules and format of messages and message transmissions~\cite{cn}. The transmitted messages in FTP include control messages, which include the commands from the client to the server and response codes from the server to the client, and data messages which is used for file transmission between client and server.~\cite{Bin}. The protocol is a fifth layer protocol of the IP stack, the application layer~\cite{gupta}, as seen in Fig~\ref{ipstack}, and is fundamentally a protocol with the intended application of sharing files between hosts~(computer programs, etc).


\begin{figure}[hbtp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1.2]{IPStack}
	\caption{IP Stack Layers}
	\label {ipstack}
\end{figure}


FTP is built on TCP/IP, and is therefore a reliable connection protocol. This project uses socket programming in order to implement FTP. Sockets can be viewed as the \textit{door} connecting the application and transport layers, as seen in Fig~\ref{socket}. The socket programs which are used to make the protocol use TCP and IP which is beyond the scope of this project and will not be discussed in detail since they belong to the transport and internet layers respectively \cite{cn}.

FTP uses a set of commands and protocols in order order to achieve desired outcome, for example, a client has to send a password along with a specific command to the server in order for the input password to be valid. Upon receiving a said command, the server replies with a code number, accompanied by text, that indicates the failure or success of the implementation of said command. 


For this project, multi-threading was used. Muti-threading allows for the same code to run in different instances, effectively allowing the same code to run independently in different processes of the computer. For this project, multi-threading is used on the server side in order to allow different clients that connect to the server to run independently on different processes of the server. The detailing of threading falls out of the scope of this project, there is however literature that discuss threading such as reference~\cite{fop}.


As mentioned above, FTP is built on TCP/IP. TCP is a transport layer protocol whose fundamental task is the transmission of data between hosts~\cite{cn,mg}. TCP transfers data in segments known as ``packets". The advantages of using TCP for data transfer are the following \cite{tcpip}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Data is transmitted in an ordered fashion according to the sequence number and rearranged at the destination.
\item Any packets that are lost (i.e. not acknowledged) are retransmitted
\item Data transfer is relatively error free due to the use of checksums
\item Reliable delivery is maintained through flow control:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The receiver is made aware of the sliding window size of the sender.
		\item A window size of zero indicates that the receiving host's buffer is full and the transfer stops and the data in the buffer is processed.
	\end{itemize}
\item Modern TCP implementations can change the flow of data to avoid network congestion
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[hbtp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale = 1.2]{socket}
	\caption{IP Stack Layers}
	\label {socket}
\end{figure}


Wireshark, a packet analyser, was also used to capture and monitor the TCP packets when operating the FTP program. This allowed the authors to verify and validate the program by witnessing control messages, reply codes and file data being transferred through the TCP connections.

In order to store passwords and user names, a database needs to be used on the server side. The author opted to use MySQL database because of its security, reliability and scalability \cite{mysql}. The database has a single table which is used to store the user name, user password, and the root directory for the said user wherein the user can perform file transfers on the server side. Due to MySQL using SQL, queries can be easily performed. An example of a useful query would be to find out if the user name, which is used in logging in when using FTP, exists~(see Fig~\ref{qu}). If the user name exists, then the server proceeds to request for the user password,etc.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	%\raggedleft
	\begin{lstlisting}
	select count(*) from user 
	where name = some_password
	\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{Querying whether user name exists}
	\label {qu}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Project Requirements}
The project requirements of the FTP program is the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  Implementation of FTP client code basic features
	\item  Implementation of FTP server code basic features
	\item  Using multi-threading
	\item  Ability to deal with different types of files
	\item  Use different computers for file transferring
	\item  Using Wireshark to view TCP packets
\end{itemize}

\section{Design and Implementation}
The design and implementation of the authors' FTP program is in three parts. The parts are the client code, server code and MySQL database table. This section discusses the three mentioned parts and their implementation.

\subsection{Database}

Databases are useful for storing information. The authors opted to use MySQL database because of the simplicity of use and the author's experience with it. A table called \textbf{user} is created in the database~(that is, MySQL) using the syntax shown in Fig~\ref{sqltable}. The table stores the user name, password of the user and the root name. The root name serves as a root directory for a user. Each root name therefore necessarily has to be unique for each user. By having unique root directory names, it is ensured that multiple users can access and use the FTP server, via the FTP client program, without affecting the data of other users. This results in ensuring that the FTP program can service multiple users as well. Due to the fact that the aforementioned table is created in using SQL~(MySQL is a SQL database), all queries performed use SQL.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	%\raggedleft
	\begin{lstlisting}
	create table user(
	user_name char(50),
	password char (50),
	root char (50),
	primary key(50)
	);
	\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{SQL code for creating a table for storing credentials}
	\label {sqltable}
\end{figure}

A visual example of this table is shown in Table~\ref{tasks}. The SQL queries that are performed in the authors' FTP  program are performed on this table. Storing the user credentials in a database instead of another storage format was chosen because of the following reasons. Firstly, by storing the data in a database ensures that the data is safely stored regardless of whether the server code is active or not. The use of the database also allows one to easily query data. Based on the authors' experience it was concluded that querying text files, csv files, etc. results in very complex code. Due to the database already using a language~(that is, SQL), the amount of code necessary to perform a query is significantly reduced. Integrating the database with python is also simple. One of the major factors for using a database is that the data can be accessed across the entire server program, whether in functions, modules and/or classes. The benefit of such accessibility is if/when working with multiple python script files, the data can be accessed without having to make provision for passing data between the scripts that may need it. This in turn, results in the server code being easily scalable in terms of having multiple users.






\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	%\raggedleft
	\begin{lstlisting}
	select count (*) 
	where user_name = someUserName
	\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{SQL code for checking if user exists}
	\label {sqluser}
\end{figure}

When the user enters the credentials stored in the database,  queries have to be performed on the database, in order to ensure that the correct user is logging in, and to dictate which root directory~(which is based on the root name column of Table~\ref{tasks}) a user can use when operating the FTP program. The basic queries that need to be performed on the table~(or database) are ones for user name verification, password verification and root name access.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	%\raggedleft
	\begin{lstlisting}
	select count (*) 
	where user_name = someUserName
	and password = somePassword
	\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{SQL code for checking if the password matches the user name}
	\label {sqlpass}
\end{figure}

When a user enters their \textit{unique} user name, a query that determines whether the user name exists in the database is executed. The SQL code example for this query is given in Fig~\ref{sqluser}. Due to the fact that each user name will be unique, when the query runs it returns either a one or a zero. When the result is a one, it means that the same user name exists in this query. When the result is zero, it means that the user name does not exist, that is, the login account does not exist.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
	%\raggedleft
	\begin{lstlisting}
	select root from user
	where user_name = someUserName
	\end{lstlisting}
	\caption{SQL code for assigning root directory name for said user}
	\label {sqlroot}
\end{figure}

Fig~\ref{sqlroot} is SQL code that returns a root folder name  for a specified user, the returned user name is used to determine the root directory of said user, as stated above. Fig~\ref{sqlpass} shows the generic SQL code that returns the number of user names where the password entered on the client side matches the one stored in the databases' user table. Due to the fact that the user names of the table always unique, if the number returned by the query is the number one, then it means the password for said user name is correct. If the returned value is zero, then it means that the password is incorrect. It is important to note that the code given in Fig~\ref{sqlpass} is only ever run if the entered user name queried in Fig~\ref{sqluser} exists. Due to this, the entered user name is always correct, and only the password authenticity is tested.



\begin{table}[hbtp!]
	\caption{Table design of SQL Database for user credentials}
	\label{tasks}
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
			%\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Software and Hardware Tools}\\
			\hline
			user-name & password & root\\
			\hline
			user1 & pass1 & root1\\
			\hline
			user2 & pass2 & root2\\
			\hline
			user3 & pass3 & root3\\
			\hline
			user4 & pass4 & root4\\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Server}
The server uses the database and queries it for user credentials and for determining root folders of each individual user, as stated above. The use of the database is embedded in the server's functions, modules, etc. This section focuses on an abstracted level of how the server interacts with the client code as demonstrated in Algorithm~\ref{serveralg1}. 

This section abstractly explains how the server is designed, and uses Algorithm~\ref{serveralg1}'s pseudo-code to explain it. Based on Algorithm~\ref{serveralg1}'s pseudo-code, it is seen that the server first connects to the database in order to enable it to make queries to the database. Once database connections are established, the server then waits for client programs to make connections to it. Once a client programs connects to the server, a thread for servicing said client program is established. From this point on, how the server operates is essentially by taking in input commands from the client and processing them, and then performing the necessary task based on the command received and then sending replies back to the client. This design pattern is followed by the server whether it be when logging in, entering passwords or downloading a file.

	\caption{Server Algorithm}\label{serveralg1}

		\Else~processCommand(commandType, commandValue)
		\EndIf
		
		}
		 
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Client}
Algorithm~\ref{clientalg1} shows the high level pseudo-code of how clients interact with the server. The client program first makes a connection to the server through the \texttt{PORT} command. Then after that the user enters commands to the client. The client then sends the commands to the client and the server responds to the client based  on the input it receives. The client then proceeds to process these commands. 
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Client Algorithm}\label{clientalg1}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Procedure{Processing Server Commands}{}
		IP $\gets$ PORT input
		connectToServer(IP)
		\While {command != 'QUIT':}{
		
		
		command $\gets$ getUserInputCommand()
		
		sendCommandToServer(command)
		
		response $\gets$ getServerResponse()
		
		responseCode $\gets$ extractResponseCode(response)
		
		processResponse (response, responseCode)
		
		\EndWhile
		}
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}

Table~\ref{commandTable} is a summary of the commands implemented by the authors' FTP program. It should be noted that the port command is specifically implemented in lower case alphabets.

When transmitting files between the client and server, the said files are read and written as binary files by the client and server programs. In python, any file type can be transmitted as binary, whether it be a text file, video, or an image. Due to this fact, the authors did not implement the \texttt{TYPE} and \texttt{MODE} commands due to them being redundant in terms of file transfer. Multiple reply code have been implemented, for each command mentioned on Table~\ref{replycodes}, there is a reply code implemented for it. In the event that a code entered by the user does not exist, the server has also implemented a reply code for it as well. The way the reply codes are used is that whenever a command is received, a reply code is sent back to the client for processing, depending on the said reply code, the server may then proceed to process data. An example of this would be when downloading a file from the server using the \texttt{RETR}, if the said file exists in the user's account, the server first sends the reply code confirming that is exists to the client and then proceeds to transfer the said file to the client.

The functionality of the commands, reply codes and formatting according to FTP standards can be found on reference~\cite{rfc959}.

\section{Code Functionality}
The client and server programs run on python 3 and user an installed MySQL database. This section gives a brief overview of how the program is used.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Please explain how it instantaniates a connections
%whether it is for example passive mode or active mode
The FTP is made to function only in active mode, this was done because according to the authors’ views, allowing a user to connect to a port of their choosing can be problematic (in terms of security) if said ports are already in use by other users. Instead, by allowing the server to automatically dictate the port number to be used, connection error probability is mitigated. The user connects to the server by typing in \texttt{port h1,h2,h3,h4,p1,p2}, where \texttt{h1-h4} is the IP address of the server (displayed in the server window) and \texttt{p1} and \texttt{p2} are the control and data ports respectively.
%%%%%%%%%

After a client connects to the server, the server then requires the user name, then the password. Once these two have been accepted by the server, the user is then free to enter any other commands at the user's discretion. When the user types 'QUIT' or simply disconnect from the server, the server acknowledges said disconnection and continues to run indefinitely while listening for other connections.


\section{Testing and Results}
Wireshark was used to monitor the packets sent and received between two computers, one running the client and the other running the server. The TCP \texttt{SYNACK} messages were clearly visible and clear-text of command codes, reply codes (see Figure \ref{wirecodes}), user names and passwords (see Figure \ref{wirenames}), and even binary file data were viewed without difficulty as shown in Figure \ref{wiredata}. Refer to Appendix \ref{appndx} for full, un-cropped images of the Wireshark capture.

\end{figure}


We can draw a conclusion from this that FTP is not secure and can easily breached. This is because FTP pre-dates SLL and TLS. As demonstrated, FTP is vulnerable to ``Packet Capture". Some of the other vulnerabilities of FTP are outlined in Reference~\cite{rfc2557} include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Using an open port to steal information
	\item FTP bounce attack, which is essentially a man in the middle attack which involves using the \texttt{PORT} command to access open ports while transfer is occurring
	\item Brute force attacks to try and guess IP and port numbers, or username and passwords
	\item Spoofing attacks in which IP data is falsified
\end{itemize}

\section{SWAT Analysis}

This section provides a SWAT analysis to the FTP program based on what the authors implemented. 

\subsection{Strengths}
Most of the basic FTP commands were successfully implemented. The program is also easily scalable due to its design.

\subsection{Weaknesses}
Some of the basic features of the program for FTP were not implemented. The program does not make use of a GUI and therefore, cannot interact with FileZilla. It also does not have a \texttt{HELP} command, so it is not very user friendly. Another weakness is that the transferred data of FTP is neither secure nor encrypted and therefore vulnerable to being 'hijacked' by outside sources.

\subsection{Advantages}
The code is simple to use and the program provides detailed error codes to inform the user what their error is.


\subsection{Trade-offs}
Some of the basic commands of FTP were not implemented because they were seen as redundant, as such, the authors chose to implement less commands and limited functionality in order to have a running code that has less chances of an error.

\section{Division of Tasks}

Due to the project requiring that a division of tasks be given, the authors opted code one python script each. Uyanda Mphunga implemented the server script and Ashraf Omar implemented the client side.

\section{Future Improvements}

For future improvements, a GUI needs to be implemented, and perhaps also allow for the neglected commands to be implemented. It would be better if a \texttt{HELP} command were implemented to instruct the user on how to use the program.

\section{Conclusion}
A file transfer protocol program was successfully written using python 3 socket programming. The FTP program used TCP connections to send control messages, receive reply codes and send and receive files through a data connection. The FTP program uses separate data and control connections as outlined in the RFC959 standard. The FTP program met all of the requirements of the project except one, which was to be able to interact with FileZilla. Wireshark was used to monitor the TCP packets being sent/received by the program. It was concluded that FTP is not designed to be secure since messages were able to be seen in plain text in the TCP packets.
